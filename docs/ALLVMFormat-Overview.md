# Overview

The basic format of the `.allexe` is a zip container that
contains various files.

## Purpose

The ALLVM Package Format is used by the ALLVM tools and
built by the ALLVM build system automation.

The format's primary design goal is to represent common
'software' components in a way that is:

* Easy to generate from reasonably organized software
* Sufficient for execution of typical user workloads
* Amenable to compiler analysis and transformations

The next section expands on the design goals further.
